GenericSymbolicTensor
  Attributes :
		_shape : internal, shape of the symbolic tensor (must match exactly the shape of the equivalent dense tensor)
		shape : property, returns _shape
		__str__ : string returned by the print command
		Vars : property, returns the list of variables of the symbolic tensor
		assign_variables_indices : internal, method to give a final ordering for all variables in the formula
		dense : returns the actual tensor corresponding to the symbolic tensor. So:
			- if self is a ReductionOp instance, it will call KeOps to perform the reduction
			- otherwise, currently returns error, but should call the equivalent NumPy/PyTorch operation
